    <section>
        <p>
            For this section, I want to show my design wireframes, flowcharts, intended experience, and the rest of that juicy design stuff. To start off with, I want to talk a bit
            about my design style process. Of course, that starts with my intended audience, which is a creative company that would be investigating me for portfolio purposes.
            To me, this means that there would be two important aspects to keep in mind. First, I want to make sure that my website is impressive technically. Of course it won't be
            the most incredible website ever created, but showcasing at least some competency in website design will be important for showing companies that I can create what I want
            to create, given enough time. Secondly, I think that user experience will be even more important than that, so I plan to center good semantic markup and clear, accessible 
            content as much as I possibly can. This leads into my wireframes, and I think that it will be best to sort them by page, so I can show inspirations where necessary and 
            demarkate them legibly.

        <p>
            For my homepage, I want to create a strong statement piece. Something that says <em>"Here I am! Look at me!"</em> In this design, I am very inspired by this portfolio page that
            I found by the French graphic designer and creative director of Jam3, Steven Mengin. I'll also link it <a href="https://www.stevenmengin.com" target="_blank">here</a>. I really like his animated background which is incredibly visually interesting while staying
            entirely readable because of good color contrast. There is notably no part of the shifting texture that can ever reach a white as bright as the font onscreen, which means the
            name is always distinct. In terms of UX, I don't like how the website has animations for scrolling, as that takes away some agency from the user in terms of navigation. However, I do like 
            how the entire portfolio is on one page, and it only takes two clicks at most to reach any interactive element of the site.

            </picture>
            These are my wireframes for the homepage and the different aspect ratios that I want to make it for. Namely, I want to have it work for iPad, iPhone, and desktop.
            I want my landing to be similar to the inspiration image that I showed, however, I want to have some tricks with opacity, where my about page (the grey box and text)
            fades in as you get to it. The same concepts that I had originally, I plan to keep the same. For that reason, and to not repeat myself forever, that's where I'll leave my plans for this page.
            The flow diagram is incredibly simple, as the only interactible element is the interaction bar at the top. I expect a user to simply scroll to the bottom then click the bar to
            navigate to other pages from there.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Blog Page</h2>
        <picture>
            <img src = "images/Blog-Screen-Wireframe.png" title = "Blog Screen Wireframe" width = "500" alt="The wireframe for the blog section of this website" style = "float: left; padding-right: 1%;">
        </picture>
        <p>
            For my blog section, I don't want there to be too much to distract the user. I want to center the reading experience and make interacting with blogs simple and intuitive,
            continuing on the same philosophy of the rest of the site. To facilitate this, there will not be a lot of visual activity to distract the reader beyond opening and closing
            of blog posts. Here, I want to mention an accessibility tradeoff that is being made for the sake of uniqueness, which is that the plan for the blog pages themselves will not
            be to have them simply in plain text. Rather, there will be some visual stylings in and around them. This may negatively impact readability, in which case the plans may be
            changed in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no inspiration for this page beyond keeping the same theming as the homepage and the rest of the website. I will be keeping a close eye on the amount of whitespace
            that it contains, and more importantly, the reading experience that it'll create. Importantly, I want to figure out more easy navigation between blogs, and so will add subnavigation
            to the hamburger bar. If possible, I would also like to add native support for font size changes and possibly plain text versions as well for accessibility purposes.
            The wireframe for the essay page is currently very similar to this one, but with no hover-over functionality for the dropdowns. In the future, this will probably be updated
            to reflect the different mood for it.

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Portfolio Page</h2>

        <p>
            For my portfolio, I want to have splash art on the full screen with contact information in the bottom corner, with the position being slightly adjusted for mobile to be
            in a more noticeable area. Then on user scroll, with the same feeling as my main page, I want to pull the user into the actual portfolio section, tabbed for the two 
            sections that are planned. Again, I want the mobile version of this page to have the tabs in a different area so that they can be switched between more easily. Additionally,
            if possible, I want to set up those tabs to remain on the top or bottom of the screen when the user scrolls down, so that they can switch views whenever they want. This will
            probably necessitate a deviation form the wireframe a little bit, so that the navigation bar doesn't interfere with the tabs. Hopefully, I can integrate 3D viewers and include
            textures to a custom element, but that's subject to change in the event that there isn't enough time. I don't expect that to be an issue though.
