            <p>
                First off, I want to acknowledge the fact that this week will be the first in which I'm writing this post on VSCode instead of word.
                I think this will help readability on the backend and also help me to format the post more for the website instead of on the editor,
                particularly for semantic markup. The topic for this blog is going to be about exactly that, semantic markup, what my target audience is, 
                and how I think they will be useful in creating my intended experience.

                So, semantic markup. What does that even mean? From my understandings of the lectures and readings from this week, semantic markup is the backbone of HTML coding. It's
                incredibly important for creating meaning, especially for screen readers and bots. For example, you might see something like <strong>this</strong>
                and something like <b>this</b>. To human eyes, there is no difference between these two elements, but behind the hood, there are pretty big differences
                between the first and second word. The first "this" uses the &lt;strong&gt; tag, which will be noticed and read by most screen readers in a different way to other text,
                whereas the second "this," using a &lt;b&gt; tag, will not be picked up differently than any other text within this post. So what does this mean practically?
                Well, good usage of semantic markup is essential for accessibility purposes. This is because not only will <em>emphasizing</em> the right words make it read better
                than simply <i>italicizing</i> them, it helps with search engine optimisation, printing, sectioning and more.

                Going back to the original question, what is the experience I want to bring to <em>my</em> website? What elements do I think will facilitate that?
                Going according to the wireframes I posted last week, the primary thing I want my website to be is easy. I want navigation to be intuitive and follow a natural
                flow, and I don't want to do anything the user wouldn't expect from what could be thought of as a typical website. Obviously, you can go and look at the diagrams
                I drew up and see that I don't exactly have a sanitised corporate hellscape in mind, but I want to prioritise that feeling of natural flow. Now, you might be wondering
                why exactly that's my intention in the first place.
            </p>
            <p>
                The answer comes down to my intended audience. I think that a portfolio website will be looked at primarily by creatives and professionals in the game design industry.
                As such, I think that a technical demonstration of the website's functionality is some of what will please the professionals, and the creatives will be more interested
                in the art, the galleries, and the games that will be hosted here. Essentially, I think the form of the website is for one crowd, and the content is for another. I don't
                believe that this will lead to an incongruity in any of my designs, but that remains to be seen, and it's never too late to discuss design changes down the road. After all,
                game design is the fusion of those fields in any case, so supplementing my own website with elements from both disciplines is the essence of what I'm studying!
