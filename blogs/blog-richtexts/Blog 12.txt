                    In my reading of the 2007 writing by Orgad on the internet as a moral space, a concept that I
                    found interesting was that of 'Proper distance'. It may be because I was just struggling to 
                    process anything that I read this week, but I couldn't quite understand how the concept was 
                    being described in that particular writing and so, for this week's blog, I want to unpack 
                    exactly what proper distance is, and why it was such a fundamentally important concept to
                    understand. I do know that this was a primary purpose of the paper, but I still think it will 
                    be valuable to create my own understanding through research.
                    To this end, I decided to start with
                    &quot;<a href="https://www.infoamerica.org/documentos_pdf/silverstone05.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proper Distance: Towards an ethics for cyberspace</a>,&quot;
                    the 2003 essay on media ethics that the reading cites, written by <cite>Roger Silverstone</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The essay opens by explaining that it's purpose is not to create a perscriptive ethical framework
                    but rather to critique <q>the increasingly intense and interactive mediation
                    of social relations by information and communication technologies</q>
                    In other words, the purpose of the essay seems to be to break down the problems inherent in 
                    social interactions being tempered by a website like twitter, tumblr, or heavens forbid,
                    4Chan.

                <p>
                    Here, Silverstone introduces the concept of proper distance. Essentially, as I understand it, he believes
                    that the maintenance and understanding of the distance between online and real-world interactions is key 
                    to maintaining an ethical and good life. In essence then, the concept of proper distance is the knowledge and 
                    understanding that you maintain as a buffer between real life and the online space. I want to stop the essay 
                    there and relate it more to a personal observation about the state of the online space as a whole,
                    but more particularly in regards to the myopia that seems to be present in a lot of discourse I've personally
                    seen on twitter. This may seem a little out of nowhere, but bear with me, I'll explain why it's important later.

                    So in general, if you've spent any time in left-leaning spaces on the internet, you may have come across outwardly
                    queer-positive accounts that act very... Uninclusive to say the least. For the purposes of this blog, I want 
                    to talk about the seemingly new rise of biphobia in places that I really didn't expect. For anyone not aware,
                    biphobia is most commonly referred to as the dismissal, hatred and erasure of bi- or pansexual identites from any number
                    of pieces of discourse. I do want to quickly acknowledge that I myself am bisexual, so this may not be an entirely 
                    unbiased recollection of the discourse, but I will do my best to remain impartial.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There seems to be a sentiment on some parts of twitter that just through the act of being bisexual and in a relationship
                    with a specific gender, this removes or invalidates the existence of the bisexual identity, such as this comment
                    captured by a user on reddit:
                    <img src="./images/Twitter/Comment_2.png" title="Twitter post" alt="A post from a user on Twitter. The post reads: 'Since you are married, may I ask what openly bisexual means? You don't have to answer'">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I don't want to talk about this ad nauseum, but the point I want to make here is that this erasure of certain 
                    queer identities is exemplary of intra-community discourse that does nothing but weaken us from the inside.
                    Even the very act of focusing on it detracts from the optical strength of our movement, even though it is 
                    something that must be pushed back on.
                    So why did I even bring this subject up? Well, I think that we can come out of it with a better understanding of
                    proper space. At the end of the day, it is clear that discourse like this is myopic and only breeds dissatisfaction.
                    To use a modern paraphrasing of the same idea, users like this need to touch grass. They are far too focused on the 
                    lives of others and litigating the internal identities of people they will never know or understand. This is the 
                    reason that, especially nowadays, we must remember the principle of proper space. We must recognize the impact that 
                    interactions on social media have on our real lives, but more importantly, we must learn to separate ourselves 
                    from it in order to pursue better activism and outcomes for the people who live here with us, instead of just 
                    in viral posts on our apps.
