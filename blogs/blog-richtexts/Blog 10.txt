        I just realised that I wrote 2 blog posts for this week ;-; been a long one I guess... I still think they're
        good writings though
    </p>
    <h5 class="p-name">Javascript Integration</h5>
    <p>
        At this point, the majority of my site is being run off of javascript. All of my blog post entries
        are stored as html richtexts that are injected into the page from a fetch function in my blog
        display code. All I need to do to add a new post is add the title and keywords to some arrays and
        they get injected automatically. Similarly, my essays are embedded in iframes when requested from
        the essay display function. All my navigation is injected, as well as my footer and menus.
        Additionally, the parallax scrolling on the main page is driven by my own custom code. I have also
        started on the backend for media queries in js that disable some of my blog page listeners
        if the user is on mobile.
    </p>
    <h5 class="p-name">Interaction Design</h5>
    <p>
        All of this javascript integration means that I have quite precise control of how and when things
        are being injected into my pages. This means that, in most cases, I am able to diagnose and fix
        problems before they become something to really worry about. Additionally, since I don't have a
        ton of content directly on my pages, I can put more focus on my actual interactions and do a lot
        of quick iterative testing and design.

        Again in this reading, I came across a comment that initially rubbed me the wrong way, but I ended
        up doing some extra research and want to reconcile the understanding I had initially and the one I
        do now, and walk through my own clarifying process.

                &quot;At the time of writing, for example, we identified 47 papers published
                this year (2020) alone by Springer Link, all claiming to have
                built algorithmic systems that “predict gender” even though
                the very idea of predicting gender has been demonstrated to
                rest on scientifically fallacious and ethically dubious grounds&quot;

        Now, as is probably evidenced in some of my other posts, I'm always wary of sweeping statements like this,
        so I decided to look more into the paper that they linked, <cite>&quot;<a
                href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3274357" target='_blank'>The Misgendering Machines</a>,&quot;
            witten
            by OS Keyes.</cite> The paper was a very interesting read, breaking down the flaws both fundamentally and in
        application of Automatic Gender Recognition systems. In short, they are fundamentally flawed because the only
        real application of gender-recognising systems would lead to dangerously bad outcomes for trans and gender
        non-conforming
        people, as it is <q>likely to misclassify (and so discriminate against) trans people.</q> This is the ethically
        dubious
        ground on which the idea of predicting gender rests.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the front of scientific inaccuracy, I believe the authors were referring to the concept of gender being a
        social
        construct rather than a simple binary, an idea echoed by Anna Lindqvista, Marie Gustafsson Sendénband and Emma
        A. Renström
        in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/epdf/10.1080/19419899.2020.1729844?src=getftr" target="_blank">this
            paper on that same concept</a>.
        Back in the paper authored by Keyes, they classify 12 papers by their gender operationalisation, particularly in how they view
        3 categories, and for each category,
        how many papers had that view.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Binary: 94.8&percnt;</li>
        <li>Immutable: 72.4&percnt;</li>
        <li>Physiological: 60.3&percnt;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Clearly, this is a huge hole in the scientific understanding of gender when it comes to this field, and so for
        that reason, the
        authors of the original paper also assert that if not completely fallacious, the scientific grounding for
        prediction of gender
        is shaky and clearly ignorant of the reality of transgender people.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, my initial skepticism was resolved through extra research, revealing that the critique by
        Birhane and Guest stands on solid ground. The scientific and ethical critiques of AGR systems are well-founded,
        emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and inclusive approach to understanding gender in computational
        sciences.
