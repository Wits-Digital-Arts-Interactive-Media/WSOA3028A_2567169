                <h5 class="p-name">How CSS relates to everything</h5>
                    <p>
                        Javascript, CSS, and HTML are commonly referred to as the &quot;holy trinity&quot; of
                        web design, and in my understanding, that's because it's all you need to create almost
                        any kind of webpage you could imagine. In my case, it lets me lay out and structure all
                        of my content in a proper, logical manner. On this page, for example, I have been able
                        to lay out my buttons and blog posts in an easy, readable way, color them, give them
                        fonts and styling, move my bookmarks to the side of the page, and tons more. Essentially,
                        I see CSS as the coat of paint that covers my functionality from Javascript and structure
                        from HTML. As a note, I did most of my styling before I was aware of grid structuring, and
                        I'll talk more about that in a bit.

                <h5 class="p-name">Responsive Design</h5>
                    <p>
                        In my opinion, the benefits of responsive design are self-evident. Making a website that's 
                        able to be moved and scaled for more screens than one means that more people with different 
                        levels of access will be able to see your website and interact with it. For important 
                        things such as voter registration and university sites, this becomes a must-have if you 
                        want people to be able to have equitable outcomes. On the other side of it, there are some 
                        challenges for responsive design that must be overcome. First off, it is more difficult to
                        design for multiple screens, especially if there is more functionality that needs to be
                        changed than expected. On this site, for example, the blog page doesn't add hover-over or
                        mouse exit listeners to the posts if the user is on mobile. This makes sure that there are 
                        no strange or unexpected outcomes when it comes to how they scroll or interact with the 
                        content. Of course, the major thing to look out for in responsive design is the time investment.
                        We must be cognizant of what elements are being placed where, otherwise we are at risk of having
                        to completely overhaul the website for different aspect ratios.

                <h5 class="p-name">Decolonial Code</h5>
                    <p>
                        The major decolonial aspect of my code that I'm attempting to focus on is accessibility,
                        particularly for the visually impaired. This, as I mention in my design section, precipitates
                        in two major areas. First, I have been using a
                        <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        colorblindness simulator</a> 
                        to ensure that my website is high-contrast and readable for all types of colorblindness. Additionally,
                        I have been paying close attention to best practices for screen-reader friendly implementations for 
                        all my pages, such as removing the a links from my buttons, as this messes with screen readers, and
                        replacing them with proper event listeners. Currently, I am aware of one accessibility issue on this page,
                        which is that I have two navigation elements, which is a fairly severe issue, but I am not sure how
                        to remedy it at this point. I will continue to develop for accessibility and do my best to incorporate
                        everything I can into achieving a good outcome.
