                    I've been staring at this screen for about 2 hours now. Truthfully, even after watching through our lectures again, I still
                    don't quite understand how to go about doing a close reading. My understanding of it is that I'm to talk about the reading I selected, and 
                    to expand on certain points as I get to them. This then, for me, is going to be a guided walkthrough of the article

                    The article starts off by giving a background of when it was written. In the midst of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a huge wave
                    of misinformation about how it started, how it spread, and how to avoid it. Famously, Donald Trump seemed

                    in order to kill the virus. People were forced to flee to the internet and to conduct business online. This article focuses more on the state of
                    the internet for those who could access it rather than the problem of access in the first place, so keep that in mind going foward.

                    &quot;...the goal was clear. Find and bring together as diverse as possible a group of African activists, thinkers, artists and feminists
                    to talk about technology, the internet and the power and impact it has on our lives and our work.&quot;

                    The article continues and talks about the inception of a feminist conference to bring together African activists in order to address the problems
                    inherent in the internet as it stood then, and which have continued to grow worse as time has gone on. They worked to analyse and explore what
                    a truly feminist internet could look like. One which represented everyone equally, independent of race, gender identity, nationality, or any other
                    marginal status that they may have. And while their goals are truly admirable, it seems that the conference has not yet been able to achieve their 
                    vision.

                    &quot;This has also become visible because of the increased incidence and reporting of gender-based violence online and technology-assisted violence.&quot;

                    In recent years, the internet and social media have seen an intense swing to the right. Most noticeable to anyone with a passing interest in it is 
                    the rise of Andrew Tate, a Romania-based sex trafficker and professed rapist. Somehow, this man gained huge popularity within the &quot;manosphere&quot;
                    and that popularity seemed to ride out from there, with reports of young schoolkids replicating his awful comments and behaviours to disastrous
                    effect. More insidiously though, there has also simultaneously been a rise in outright hatred towards LQBTQIA+ persons, as well as the popularisation
                    of the nazi groups that thrive off of this kind of sexism, racism, transphobia, and everything else you can think of. In such a hostile environment,
                    the concept of creating a safe space for marginalised people in the South African sphere may seem like a pipe dream, but that is exactly what Magenya
                    and those in the conference are still aiming to do.

                    Next, the article shows how it plans to fight back. In such a divisive space, where hate and vitriol run rampant, it is then our duty to
                    create one that does the opposite. One that accepts people for who they are and espouses the progressive messages we want to see being spread throughout
                    the broader internet. Sex and sexuality, Body positivity, Gender non-comformity. All of the things that one might feel scared to mention or talk about
                    around more conservative people are exactly the things that <strong>must</strong> be talked about in order to have a safer, more compassionate society
                    for everyone.
