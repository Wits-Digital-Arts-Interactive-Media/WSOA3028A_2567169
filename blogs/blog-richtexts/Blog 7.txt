                    For this week, we were tasked to do some readings and reflect on how they relate and impact our thinking about web development as a South African.
                    Before I get into the analysis, I want to discuss my research methodology for the <a href="https://rgs-ibg.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first reading</a>, as it was incredibly dense for me. After trying 
                    unsuccessfully for an hour or so to get through the first of 18 pages, I looked unsuccessfully for a screen reader that I could use, then eventually
                    settled on using artificial intelligence. What I did was have ChatGPT 3.5 summarise whatever I sent to it, then sent the paper in sections. I've linked
                    the full conversation <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/2207eeca-90c3-4f48-93bb-c84247bd9072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. If the 
                    link becomes depreciated at some point, you can also view the transcript <a href="ChatGPT_Research_Paper_Summary_Blog_7.txt" target="_blank">here</a>. I also
                    read &quot;<a href="https://www.internetjustsociety.org/internet-access-is-a-fundamental-rights-especially-amidst-a-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Internet access is a fundamental right</a>&quot; 
                    by Spyros Kasapis. I'm going to use that second reading as the basis for my response, while referring to information in the first one to back up
                    my words, then talk about how everything I've talked about in the last few weeks fits together and how it impacts my outlook as a web designer.

                <p>
                    To be honest, internet access as a fundamental human right in this day and age seems, well, fundamental to participating in the global discussion.
                    More importantly, I want to hone in on the concept of information access. As I write this, I am the subject of uncountable priviliges, even if they
                    are not visible to me. I'm white, cisgender, and the only disability I can speak of is ADHD. So long as I don't mention my religion or sexuality
                    in certain places, I'm relatively safe in most parts of society. Above immediate danger, however is something that I didn't even realise before 
                    reading the research paper. I, and everyone taking this course, are part of an incredibly lucky group of people. Especially in Africa, where
                    costs for internet broadband are prohibitively expensive for a large portion of the population. Further than that, though, I and those in the course
                    with me are in an even smaller group, considering that, according to the conglomerated GitHub data from the research, 
                    <q>South Africa consisting of 0.46% of users, but only 0.36% of all commits.</q>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, how does all of this fit together? What do all these bleak numbers actually mean for me as a South African web designer?
                    Well, especially when talking about this and last week's blog, we can see a theme starting to emerge that the global south is sorely
                    underrepresented in the online content creation space. The internet as it exists now may be incredible, but access to it is worse than could ever
                    be predicted. Newer websites like Temu, the one I spoke about in my essay, are able to run rampant in this climate due to global negligence
                    towards education and financial equality. Furthermore, the people who are even able to get caught up in advertising are already in the slim majority
                    of privilege. As to what it means, it will be different to everyone. That's the point of decolonialisation. But to me, it tells me that I have a 
                    job to do. As someone in a privileged position, I need to advocate for those who can't. I need to be one of those who creates the space for the voiceless
                    to speak. This doesn't mean the far fringes of Twitter leftism to me, it means conscious and considered advocacy, pushing where I can with what 
                    I can in order to affect as much change from the inside as I can. While the system itself can't be changed by a single person in my position,
                    it can be modified. It can be added to. It can be developed.
