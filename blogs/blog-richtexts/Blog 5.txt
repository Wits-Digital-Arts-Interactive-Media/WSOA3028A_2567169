                    Okay, so for this post, I want to go over all of the candidate sites for my UI/UX essay, what I think will be interesting about them to talk about,
                    and what the cons of these analyses might be. Before anything, let me go over my list of candidate sites and why I think they could make for an interesting
                    essay. After that, I'll go in detail with each one and discuss my thought process.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Twitch - could be interesting to go into detail on how streams are vended to consumers</li>
                        <li>D&DBeyond - being the most popular dungeons and dragons site, it could be fun to focus on how they enable homebrew/ the ease with which you can make it</li>
                        <li>Temu - we could talk about how incredibly predatory everything on the site is, both in UI and UX</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                    As background, twitch is a video streaming platform used by millions of people. It's primarily used for games, but recently more experimental
                    content is being made to push the boundaries of what Twitch can be. Here, you can find cooking streams, musicians, artists and more. Even then, the
                    platform is tailored mainly to gamers. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pro: There is a lot to talk about here for the UI, as well as some interesting colour theory in regards to notifications and the like.</li>
                        <li>Con: There might be too much to talk about for UI. There are tons of different recommendation systems at play here and it may get too formulaic to go into 
                            each one.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pro: The UI is very responsive, and there's feedback everywhere. This means there is rich ground for different studies on stimulus response on users.</li>
                        <li>Con: I am not very familiar with how this site works. As such, it might be harder to do accurate research and be confident in my results.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>D&amp;DBeyond</strong>
                <br>
                <img src="images/Website Analysis/D&DBeyond-Homepage.jpg" width="80%" title="D&DBeyond Homepage" alt="A screenshot of D&DBeyond's homepage as displayed to me">
                </p>
                <p>
                    D&amp;DBeyond is the most popular site for dungeons and dragons character creation and play that I'm aware of. To me, one of the most unrealised features
                    in this site is the homebrew editor. In an essay I'd love to go into detail as to why this is, what elements of the UX design make it unappealing to me,
                    and what could be done in the future to make it more intuitive and easy. 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pro: This is a topic that's close to me, so it'll be easy to talk about</li>
                        <li>Con: Because of my familiarity with it, it might be difficult to speak in an unbiased way.</li>
                        <li>Pro: The UX design is pretty terrible in the homebrew screen, which makes it fertile ground for an overhaul.</li>
                        <li>Con: Because of the nature of the essay this would create, it would be very hard to find good studies to back up the points that I make.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Temu</strong>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Temu is an up-and-coming e-commerce site that I was made aware of recently by my family. I think it is incredibly predatory in both its marketing
                    and in how it implements pretty much every part of it's UI and UX. Going into how it uses underhanded tactics to force consumers into spending more
                    than they intended may be a very compelling topic.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pro: The UI and UX of this website is so blatantly following dark design patterns that it will be easy to write about.</li>
                        <li>Con: Because of how common practices like this are, it may not be a unique essay topic.</li>
                        <li>Pro: Because this derives from common real-world marketing practices, there will be a huge body of researh with regards to exactly what
                            techniques are being used where.
                        </li>
                        <li>Con: I loathe business practices like this, and I doubt I'd be able to keep that partiality out of my writing.</li>
                    </ul>
