                    For this week, I was reading the first assigned text when I noticed a practice that was being engaged in which I don't fully agree with.
                    On the third page of the reading, the writers say the following:
                    <figure>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                &quot;Coloniality is constitutive, not derivative, of modernity. 
                                That is to say, there is no modernity without coloniality, thus the
                                compound expression: modernity/coloniality.&quot;
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <cite>
                            On Decoloniality Concepts, Analytics, Praxis - Introduction
                        </cite>
                    </figure>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, on the surface of this quote, there doesn't seem to be much objectionable content. The authors assert that coloniality is a core
                    part of the concept of modernity, and thus they use the words interchangeably in the rest of the paper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, in my layman's opinion, this sentiment seems to indicate the very colonial attitudes that the authors are expounding upon in the paper.
                    In the rest of this post I plan to go a bit more in-depth on the definition of modernity here, discuss the implicit bias in that definition as I 
                    understand it, then finally attempt to separate the ideas expressed here. To be clear, this is <em>not</em> an attempt to gotcha the authors of this
                    paper or anything like that, but merely an exploration of the language they chose to use and how I see it as objectionable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So with that being said, how do we actually define &quot;modernity?&quot; Well, going off of the common definition, we can understand modernity as the
                    changes within technology and society that are happening now; In other words, in this understanding, modernity is characterised by only forward progress.
                    Now, in this definition I could see where the authors could be drawing their criticisms. After all, within a decolonial context, we can clearly see that
                    to define modernity by this progress is inherently heirarchical in nature. It is the bourgeoisie who decide what direction forward is. So then,
                    in this definition, modernity is inherently and inextricably linked with colonialism, and so can be understood as synonymous with it. However,
                    there is yet another assumption that is made in this definition that I feel is equally important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's go back to the definition of modernity as expressed before. Forward progress, which is defined within the context of the ruling class.
                    However, this, too, does not encapsulate the meaning of modernity in my mind. The reason for this is simple. Colonialism is inherently bad. It is 
                    heirarchical, exploitative, and does not care for the lives and cultures of those not situated within the ruling class. However, to choose to make
                    the concept of modernity synonymous with this idea lacks the nuance needed when discussing topics like this. There are good areas within modernity 
                    which exist despite colonial oppression. Medical technology that saves lives, supply chains to feed millions, and the slow advancement of social
                    justice are indeed products of modernity, and while I do believe they would be in a better state without colonialism, I do not think they would
                    have the space to exist in premodern times, but more importantly, tying them to the existence of colonialism is problematic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are negative aspects of modernity, both the explicit and the implicit. Both in outright social injustice and in the 
                    malignant stains on our perception of reality. However, in pushing all aspects of modernity under the category of colonialism, 
                    we trample over the hard work and suffering of decolonial advocates of the past. their hard work and sacrifice has contributed to genuine,
                    positive social change that is important to acknowledge and celebrate. More importantly, modernity itself is not and should not be a concept 
                    that we allow only the mechanisms of colonialism to define. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, there are many elements of colonialism that are inherent to our understanding of modernity, but there are also positives that come from both 
                    within and without the typical colonial framework that should not be discarded in favour of creating a synonym.

                    As a note, I know that there are other prompts in the blog post section, however I feel that this was an important and interesting topic to go 
                    into, based on the research links that we were given.
