            <p>This week was spent mostly outlining the wireframes for my eventual website. I want to use this post to go in-depth on the decisions I made and the reasons for making them. I’m going to scan each wireframe into here and talk about how they’re going to work and the possible challenges that might come up with integrating them.</p>
            <p>First is my index/homepage
            <img src = "images/Index_Wireframe.png" alt="A wireframe of the planned look for the homepage"></p>
            <p>Going from the top down, I would like to have a navigation bar that always stays in the corner of the screen, regardless of page or position. It will open sideways to reveal main pages, with a secondary dropdown that can be used for quicker navigation if needed. On the main screen, there will be a title which has the purpose of drawing the user in. If the user scrolls down, the second about screen will move up over the main title. As that screen comes into focus, the main title will lose opacity as the about page gains opacity, taking the place of the former main title. When the user has hit the bottom of the about page, there will be a trigger that will cause the navigation bar to grow and shake a little, reminding the user that it’s there and hopefully guiding them to click it and move to other parts of the website.</p>
            <p>I want the blog page to look as follows:
            <img src = "images/Blog_Wireframe.png" alt="A wireframe of the planned look for the blog page"></p>
            <p>Each blog post will be separated out into its own block, with the blog title and keywords visible. When the user hovers over a post, a short summary of the contents will appear, slightly pushing down the blogs below. When a user clicks a post, it will expand fully, showing the entire post in the box and pushing everything below it even further. While simple, I believe this system is intuitive and should lead to a good user experience.</p>
            <p>In a similar vein, I think the essay tab should feel like the blog page but should also lead the user to an understanding of the fact that it’s longer form and more of a commitment to read.
            <img src = "images/Essay_Wireframe.png" alt="A wireframe of the planned look for the Essay page"></p>
            <p>In this layout, essays are given a title and a persistent summary that stays in place regardless of where the cursor is placed. Instead of opening as embedded text in the page, the essay will open in a new page. This is useful because it enables bookmarking in the url with hashtags, as well as being able to have it open on a separate tab. This approach should lead to a slower, more intentional reading than blog posts, which feel less commital to open.</p>
            <p>Finally, my portfolio page will serve as an advertisement and gallery.
            <img src="images/Folio_Wireframe.png" alt= "A wireframe of the planned look for the portfolio page"></p>
            <p>On the main part of the portfolio, there will be a large splash image with links to my projects and various pages. Beneath that will be the gallery section, seperated out into distinct tabs for whatever media becomes important to display. The gallery section will simply house images of paintings or renders that I’ve made, laid out quite simply to de-emphasize anything but the artwork itself. The 3D models tab will have the same design philosophy, but with a 3D viewer and a tab to look at all the separate textures and maps that were used to produce the final product.</p>
