        <p>
            For this section, I want to show my design wireframes, flowcharts, intended experience, and the rest of that juicy design stuff. To start off with, I want to talk a bit
            about my design style process. Of course, that starts with my intended audience, which is a creative company that would be investigating me for portfolio purposes.
            To me, this means that there would be two important aspects to keep in mind. First, I want to make sure that my website is impressive technically. Of course it won't be
            the most incredible website ever created, but showcasing at least some competency in website design will be important for showing companies that I can create what I want
            to create, given enough time. Secondly, I think that user experience will be even more important than that, so I plan to center good semantic markup and clear, accessible 
            content as much as I possibly can. This leads into my wireframes, and I think that it will be best to sort them by page, so I can show inspirations where necessary and 
            demarkate them legibly.

            For my homepage, I want to create a strong statement piece. Something that says <em>"Here I am! Look at me!"</em> In this design, I am very inspired by this portfolio page that
            I found by the French graphic designer and creative director of Jam3, Steven Mengin. I'll also link it <a href="https://www.stevenmengin.com" target="_blank">here</a>. I really like his animated background which is incredibly visually interesting while staying
            entirely readable because of good color contrast. There is notably no part of the shifting texture that can ever reach a white as bright as the font onscreen, which means the
            name is always distinct. In terms of UX, I don't like how the website has animations for scrolling, as that takes away some agency from the user in terms of navigation. However, I do like 
            how the entire portfolio is on one page, and it only takes two clicks at most to reach any interactive element of the site.

            These are my wireframes for the homepage and the different aspect ratios that I want to make it for. Namely, I want to have it work for iPad, iPhone, and desktop.
            I want my landing to be similar to the inspiration image that I showed
